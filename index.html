                <p>
                    When I was a kid I used to struggle with weight problems both over and under. I used to be a very scrawny kid and I then 
                    got fairly chubby when I was 8-15 yrs. old and then shortly after when I was 16 I started to lose weight and became 
                    a much healthier by eating better and even joining the soccer team. I eventually lost over 60lbs. and actually ended up 
                    almost going underweight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that I wanted to go into computer science to make sure I was feeling the vibes you get me Idk I was 
                    just feeling it you know you get? You picking up what im putting down? I want you know one thing to whoever 
                    reads this at the time of making this I was stressed and late on hw by little I was tired I had date 
                    with the best girl ever and I was thinking about that all day and shortly behind came the stress of this hw 
                    so I ask you have you ever felt this way before. A way that makes you feel like your floating in air? Like a speck of dust 
                    residing in the emptiness of space? Does value come from the things you do? Or from the value others put onto you? I don't know.
                    Sometimes I wonder if everthing I do has true value? But then I rememember I live for myself and only myself so why not be haopy with 
                    what I do? I ask you this... Do you feel truly accomplished or did you long route to feel nothing? OOga Booga.
